## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest
1. The blockchain is a collection of ditributed computers that are used to facilitate secure and decentralized computation,
transaction and storage of digital assets.


2. A Smart Contract is a way to define how to execute a predetermined situation. For example, if you want to create a resource,
the smart contract outlines who has that authority, what and where the resource will be created, including but not limited to 
when it gets created.

3. Running a script is free and returns/reads the state of the blockchain. A transaction is not free and modifies the state
of the blockchain.
