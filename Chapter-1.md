## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest
1. The blockchain is a collection of ditributed computers that are used to facilitate secure and decentralized computation,
transaction and storage of digital assets.


2. A Smart Contract is a way to define how to execute a predetermined situation. For example, if you want to create a resource,
the smart contract outlines who has that authority, what and where the resource will be created, including but not limited to 
when it gets created.

3. Running a script is free and returns/reads the state of the blockchain. A transaction is not free and modifies the state
of the blockchain.

## Chapter 1 Day 2 Quest
The Five Pillars are:
  1. Safety and Security
  2. Clarity
  3. Approachability
  4. Developer Experience
  5. Resource Oriented Programming


- Safety and security are important because you want the foundation of the blockchain you are working on to be consistent and
stable. Meaning the code in production works day in and day out without having to worry about breaking changes from the
infrastructure. 
- Code clarity means that code should mean what it says. Meaning that, with a basic understanding of the language
syntax a developer should be able to understand what the code is doing, not necessarily what the dev was trying to do.
- Show me the documentation! Cadence was designed to be approachable by design. Even though I still have trouble spinning up the
cadence language server on VS Code on Ubuntu, the Cadence Playground is a great way to get started.
- Developer experience is directly proportional to how much you want to keep using that language. Lisp peeps, don't @ me.
