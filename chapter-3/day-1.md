## Chapter 3 Day 1 Quest

### Answers 
- Structs are diffrent from resources because:
  1. Structs can be copied therefore, uniqueness is not required or enforced.
  2. Structs are containers for data.
  3. Structs are not meant to be used to represent ownership of assets.

- It makes sense to use a resource instead of a struct in cases where 

- The ```create``` keyword is used to create a new resource.

- Resources cannot be created outside of contracts and result in an error in a script and transaction.
